<h1>Virtual Pet</h1>

A virtual pet built with Javascript as part of the programming fundimentals track at Manchester Codes. 

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>This game is designed to create a Tamagotchi style virtual pet, which you can look after with regular feeding and exercise. 

As your pet grows, their fitness and hunger will decrease and increase respectively. Checking your pet's status is the best way to stay on top of catering for it's needs!

Be sure not to neglect them too much, or sadly your pet will die ðŸ’€ Just like a real pet then! Except you can't play with it...

FRET NOT! I have also added a play method, which will increase your pet's happiness. Be sure to play with them often, or like me, your pet may die of sadness.</p>
