<h1>Virtual Pet</h1>
    <p>
        A virtual pet built with Javascript as part of the programming fundimentals track at Manchester Codes. 
    </p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        This game is designed to create a Tamagotchi style virtual pet, which you can look after with regular feeding and exercise.</br>
        As your pet grows, their fitness and hunger will decrease and increase respectively. Checking your pet's status is the best way to stay on top of catering for it's needs!</br>
        Be sure not to neglect them too much, or sadly your pet will die ðŸ’€ Just like a real pet then! Except you can't play with it...</br>
        FRET NOT! I have also added a play method, which will increase your pet's happiness. Be sure to play with them often, or like me, your pet may die of sadness.
